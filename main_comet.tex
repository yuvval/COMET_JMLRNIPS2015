Learning distance metrics from data is a useful way to extract data-driven features, by using the matrix root of a distance matrix. Finding a metric amounts to optimization over the cone of positive definite (PD) matrices. This optimization is difficult since projecting to the PD cone after update steps is prohibitively costly, as is restricting optimization to remain within the PD cone.

Here we describe COMET, a block-coordinate descent procedure, which efficiently keeps the search within the PD cone, avoiding both costly projections and unnecessary computation of full gradients. COMET also continuously maintains the Cholesky root of the matrix, hence allows feature extraction and embedding of samples in a metric space. We further extend COMET to enforce structured sparsity, where only a small number of features can interact with other features, significantly accelerating both training and inference while maintaining interpretability. 
 
As a block-coordinate descent procedure, COMET has fast convergence bounds showing linear convergence with high probability. When tested on benchmark datasets in a task of retrieving similar images and similar text documents, COMET significantly outperforms competing projection-free methods. We further show that on a document classification task with the RCV1 dataset, sparse-COMET achieves $99\%$ of the nearest neighbor precision of dense COMET, while cutting training time by a factor of $4.5$, maintaining a $0.5\%$ sparsity level, and outperforming competing methods both in precision and in run time.

\section{Introduction}
\vskip -5pt
Metric learning, learning a measure of pairwise distance among data samples, is a an approach for extracting features in a data-driven way, and a fundamental task in machine learning. Learned metrics can be used to project the data into a new feature space, providing a representation for supervised learning techniques based on distances such as nearest-neighbors or kernel methods \citep{kulis2012survey}.
Learned metrics can also be used for ranking samples similar to a query sample, like finding similar images, or recommend online content to a user visiting a webpage. 

Metric learning is tightly related to convex feature extraction, for the following reason. Learning a metric is often cast as solving a convex optimization problem over the cone of positive definite (PD) matrices by optimizing a similarity measure $sim_W (x,y) = x^\top W y$ such that $W \in \R^{d \times d}$ is a PD matrix  \citep{kulis2012survey,bellet2013survey}. 
When $\W$ is PD, it can be factored as $\W= \cholL\T \cholL$, and $\cholL$ can be used to map any data sample $x$ to a new feature space $\cholL x$. Unfortunately, enforcing the PD constraint has a high computational cost. Projections to the PD cone require an eigendecomposition which is cubic in the number of features, or restricting optimization to the PD cone which is hard to perform efficiently. As a result, metric learning has been limited to mid-sized problems, and finding efficient optimization algorithms for metric learning is an ongoing thorny challenge. 

A major opportunity to speed metric learning and inference lies in the sparsity structure of the learned metric. At the extreme, enforcing the matrix to be diagonal could speed learning and inference dramatically, but it would ignore all interactions among feature pairs and does not extract any new features from  data. Other sparse approaches focus on adding a limited number of off-diagonal entries \citep{HDSL}, and achieve state-ofthe-art results in some sparsity regimes. Another natural sparsity structure that was not explored before, is the case were some features are limited to the diagonal, while another small set of features, determined from data, have off-diagonal terms. We show here that this structure can be learned very efficiently, that it dramatically speeds learning and inference, while the added sparsity constrains hardly hurt performance. 

This paper describe two new efficient algorithms for learning PD metrics called {\em{COordinate-descent METric learning}} (COMET), introducing a cost-effective method for performing block-coordinate descent over PD  matrices. The first algorithm, dense-COMET, learns a dense PD matrix efficiently, while limiting optimization within the PD cone. The second algorithm, sparse-COMET, further introduces a new sparsity structure and uses it to speed training and inference. Both COMET algorithms  efficiently optimize standard metric learning loss functions, while maintaining a PD matrix model continuously during learning, with no need for eigendecompositions. 

COMET operates by updating the learned matrix one column and row at a time, thus updating the terms relating to one feature at each iteration. We use a $\log \det$ term as a barrier function for the PD cone, and employ the Schur complement to efficiently calculate an exact bound over the step size that guarantees that the model remains within the PD cone. Evaluations of COMET on benchmark datasets show that it outperforms other continuous-PD metric learning methods, and that sparse-COMET identifies highly informative features.

%\todo{Give highlights of experimental results? }

\ignore{Furthermore an important challenge for metric learning is the case where the set of features is not fixed in advance, but changes with time. This is a typical scenario in many real life applications of learning: as more data accumulates, it is possible to estimate more parameters accurately, so more features and signals are gradually added to existing systems. It is therefore desirable to develop algorithms that can learn metrics in face of a growing feature set. Our method naturally adapts to this setting, by optimizing the metric matrix one column-row at a time.}

\section{Related work}
\vskip -5pt
Learning distance metrics and metric similarity measures from data has been intensively studied, see \citet{bellet2013survey, kulis2012survey} for recent surveys. We focus on learning Mahalanobis distance matrices as described below. A major challenge in this domain is to efficiently enforce the PD matrix constraint during optimization. The simplest approach is to project the learned matrix onto the cone of PSD matrices, but this projection amounts to solving an eigendecomposition problem and is therefore costly (generally cubic in the feature dimensionality). The number of projections can be cleverly reduced but each projection is still slow \citep{qianHD, qian}. A second common approach is to learn a factored model $\cholL\T \cholL$, but in that case the learning problem is no longer convex. 

A second line of work avoids the costly projections by keeping optimization within the PSD cone. \citet{davis2007information} and \citet{lego} took this approach and introduced a $\log \det$ divergence term which acts as a log-barrier regularizer term. Another type of projection-free methods views a PSD matrix as a combination of other simpler PSD matrices. HDSL \citep{HDSL} learns a PSD matrix as a weighted combination of rank-1 sparse PSD update matrices, which are all zeros except for a $2\times2$ entry corresponding to a pair of feature. BoostMetric \citep{boost} learns the metric matrix using rank-1 (PSD) updates which are generated by a boosting-based process. See also \citet{bi2011adaboost, liu2012robust}.

\citet{ying2009sparse} present a method for Sparse Metric Learning. However, their method in fact regularizes the learned matrix with the squared \emph{trace-norm}. This yields low-rank but not truly sparse metrics. Their method also has a slower convergence rate, and is based on iteratively solving $|T|$-dimensional quadratic problems with linear constraints, where $|T|$ is the number of training triplets, as well as requiring a repeated full eigendecompositions.

\vskip -5pt
\section{The learning setup}
\vskip -5pt
We address the problem of learning a metric over a set of
entities, like images or text documents based on their
relative pairwise similarities. Formally, let $\cal{P}$ be a set of entities $\{\p_1,...,\p_N\}$ each represented as a vector in $\Rd$. We measure the similarity of two samples $\q, \p \in \cal{P}$ using a bilinear form parametrized by a model $\W \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$, $S_{\W}(\q, \p) = \q\T \W \p$.
When the matrix $\W$ is PSD, it can be factored as $\W = \cholL\T \cholL$ and used to define a similarity measure over pairs of data points. Specifically, the similarity $x^\top\W y$ between two data points $x$ and $y$ through the matrix $\W$, is equivalent to an Euclidean inner product  $(\cholL x)^\top(\cholL y)$ in the transformed space $x \mapsto \cholL x$. 

We assume that a weak form of supervision is given in the form of a ranking over triplets~\citep{weinberger2006dml,OASIS,qian}. Such ranking supervision is often easy to obtain and has widely achieved good performance . We assume we have access to triplets of entities from $\cal{P}$, where each triplet $t$ consists of
a ``query'' instance $\qt \in \cal{P}$, and two instance $\pt^{+}, \pt^{-} \in \cal{P}$ such that $\qt$ is more similar to $\pt^{+}$
than to $\pt^{-}$.

We aim to find a similarity measure $S_{\W}$ that agrees with the ranking of these triplets, namely, $S_{\W}(\q, \p^{+}) > S_{\W}(\q,
\p^{-})$. To achieve this, we use one of the following triplet loss functions
\begin{align}
\label{single-triplet-lossed}
l_{\W}^h(\qt, &\pt^{+}, \pt^{-}) = [1-\qt\T\W\pt^+ + \qt\T\W\pt^-]_{+}
 \\ \nonumber
 %\label{single-triplet-hinge-loss2}
l_{\W}^{hs}(\qt, &\pt^+, \pt^-) = [1-\qt\T\W\pt^+ + \qt\T\W\pt^-]_{+}^2
 \\ \nonumber
 %\label{single-triplet-log-loss} 
l_{\W}^{log}(\qt, &\pt^+, \pt^-) = log(1+exp(-\qt\T\W\pt^+ + \qt\T\W\pt^-)) \nonumber ,
\end{align}
where $[z]_{+} \eqdef \max(0,z)$. Given a batch of $\cal{T}$ triplets, adding a Frobenius regularization term, and a log-barrier term, we aim to solve the following regularized optimization problem

\begin{equation}
\label{eq-logdet-loss}
L(W) = 
  \min_{\W} \sum_{\trip \in \cal{T}}  l_{\W}(\qt, \pt^+, \pt^-) - \alpha \log \det(\W) + \frac{\beta}{2} \frobsq{\W},
\end{equation}
where $l_{\W}$ is any of the triplet loss functions and $\frobsq{\W}$ is the squared Frobenius norm of the matrix $\W$. This optimization problem is convex in $\W$.
The log-barrier term ensures that the optimum is within the PD cone. Note that the method we introduce in \ref{subsec:step} allows for all iterates to remain within the PD cone even without the log-barrier term. However, we found that introducing the log-barrier term contributed both to empirical performance and numerical stability, especially when the optimum is close to the PSD cone edge.

  \min_{\W}& \sum_{\trip=1}^{\cal{T}}  l_{\W}(\qt, \pt^+, \pt^-) + \frac{\beta}{2} \frobsq{\W}

Previous metric learning approaches \citep{OASIS, qianHD, qian}, solved the constrained optimization problem by SGD or stochastic mini-batch gradient steps, while repeatedly projecting back to the convex cone of PD matrices.

An alternative approach is to use a log-barrier term and avoid projecting onto the PD cone \citep{davis2007information,lego}, yielding}


The loss in \eqref{eq-logdet-loss} can be minimized using gradient descent (GD), computing the gradient w.r.t. $\W$ for a set of triplets

\end{equation}
%{l'}(\lambda_{t}^{\W})
%where $l'(x) \eqdef \frac{\partial {l(x)}}{\partial x}$, $\Delta\vec{p}_{t} \eqdef (\vec{p}_{t}^{-} - \vec{p}_{t}^{+})$
where $\Delta\p_t = \p_t^- - \p_t^+$, and $l'(x) \eqdef \frac{d{l(x)}}{dx}$ is the outer derivative of the loss function (see Appendix A for derivation of the triplet loss).

\section{Learning a PD metric with block-coordinate descent: Dense COMET}
\label{learing_dense_comet}
\vskip -5pt
The learning setup above is commonly studied, but 
optimizing it using gradient descent is computationally hard, because the $\log \det$ term yields a $\W^{-1}$ term in the gradient \eqref{gradMtx}. This term makes naive implementations with matrix inversion slow, scaling cubically with the matrix dimension. Another difficulty is that while in theory the $\log \det$ term ensures that the optimum is within the PD cone, in practice the intermediate iterates for first-order methods are not necessarily confined to the cone. The reason is that the gradients of the $\log \det$ term are not Lipschitz and any fixed step size might take the update outside the cone. Forcing the objective to be Lipschitz by adding a small constant term to the diagonal of $\W$, would still require the step size to be small to ensure remaining within the cone, leading to slower convergence. 
% A second problem concerns the effect of the $\log \det$ barrier on the solution space. In many applications the actual matrix that minimizes the above loss is near the boundary of the cone. This is the case when using human judgment on similarity as a supervision signal. In these cases, when optimizing without using the PSD constraint, one often finds the optimum outside or near the boundary of the PSD cone. The problem is that if the only component keeping the solutions inside the PSD cone is the $\log \det$ term, it may distort the gradients near the boundary of the convex set. 

We propose an algorithm that alleviates these problems by using efficient block-coordinate descent that keeps optimization within the PD cone while essentially amortizing the cost of matrix inversion.
In general, block-coordinate descent enjoys provably fast convergence rates, and is especially useful when the block update is efficient, as we show below. We derive a method that enables using as large as possible step size and still remain within the PD cone for all iterates, based on the Schur complement condition for PD matrices \citep[p. 650]{boyd2004convex}.

%Our algorithm applies block-coordinate descent as follows. At each step, a single feature is drawn at random; The matrix entries on the corresponding row and column are treated as a block and all get updated. Importantly, we compute analytically a bound on the size of the update step, which guarantees that the updated matrix remains positive definite. %Without the bound, taking a coordinate step may take $\newW$ out of the PD cone, even if the objective holds a $\log\det$ barrier term.

We perform the block updates as follows: %First, since $\W$ is PD it is also symmetric, hence we replace $\W$ in \eqref{eq-logdet-loss} with $\tfrac{1}{2}(\W + \W\T)$. This guarantees that the gradient resulting from \eqref{gradMtx} is also symmetric.
Draw a feature $k \in \{1 \ldots d$\} at random, and define a matrix $\mat{G}$ that is all zeros except the values of $-\grd$ on the $k$-th row and $k$-th column. Finally, update the matrix $\newW = \W +\eta \mat{G}$, using a step size $\eta$ that is computed analytically so as to keep the iterates with the PD cone -  see Subsection \ref{subsec:step}.
To hold the $\log\det$ derivative terms, $(\newW)^{-1}$ is also maintained and updated: using the Woodbury inverse matrix identity \citep{woodbury1950inverting}, and given $\W^{-1}$. This update costs $O(d^2)$, see Appendix B for details.

\subsection{Selecting a step size that guarantees remaining within the PD cone}\label{subsec:step} \vskip -4pt
As discussed above, taking a coordinate step may take $\newW$ out of the PD cone. On Appendix B, we show that given $\W$ and $\mat{G}$ the step size can be bounded to guarantee that $\newW$ remains PD, and that the bound can be computed efficiently using the Schur complement condition for positive definiteness. In turn, the condition reduces to a scalar inequality for the case of row-column update:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:schurCond0}
  \newW \succ  0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad  \C^* - \B^*\T \invA \B^* >  0,
\end{equation}
where w.l.g. we assume we updated the first row-column, and $\C^* = \Wscalar^{new} \in \R$ (a scalar), $\B^* = \Wvec^{new} \in \R^{d-1}$ (a column vector) and $A^* = \newW_{2:d,2:d} = \W_{2:d,2:d}\in \R^{(d-1)}$. Condition \eqref{eq:schurCond0} induces a condition over the step size $\eta$, which gives us with an upper limit to the allowable step size of a block coordinate (row-column) step over \eqref{gradMtx}. Respecting the upper limit guarantees the updated matrix $\W^{new}$ will be PD. The computational complexity for calculating the upper limit is $O(d^2)$. The details of the calculation are brought in Appendix B. We note that in practice we use a Cholesky solver \citep{CHOLMOD} to speed up training and maintain the matrix square root. See details in Appendices B and C.

%We chose to use a Cholesky solver \citep{CHOLMOD} for evaluating the step size condition efficiently. Therefore, we maintain an updated Cholesky root matrix $\cholL$ s.t. $W = \cholL\T \cholL$. Updating $\cholL$ following an update step costs $O(d^2)$ \citep{Davis05rowchol}. Maintaining an updated Cholesky root matrix also provides an embedding of the features to the metric space throughout the progress of the training. This approach is summarized in Algorithm \ref{alg:comet}.


\subsection{Convergence rate}\vskip -5pt
Our method is based on minimizing a strongly convex function using block-coordinate descent. Since the blocks in our method are partially overlapping, we use a convergence result by \citet{richtarik2013optimal} to analyze the convergence of the algorithm, and show that Algorithm 1 converges with high probability to the optimum value in linear rate. The analysis holds for the squared hinge-loss and the log-loss, but not for the hinge-loss which is not smooth. For lack of space we defer the precise statement to Theorem 1 in Appendix D.

\ignore{The objective $L(\W)$ in \eqref{eq-logdet-loss} is strongly convex but is not smooth, since the gradient of the $\log \det$ term is unbounded near the envelope of the PD cone. Let $\tilde{L}({\W}) = L({\W + \kappa I_d})$ be a modified version of the loss in Eq. \ref{eq-logdet-loss}, where $I_d$ is the $d \times d$ identity matrix, and $\kappa>0$ is a fixed parameter.
We prove the following Theorem (see Appendix D):
\begin{theorem}
Let $\W^t$ be the $t$-th iterate of Algorithm \ref{alg:comet} with objective function $\tL$, sampling each column-row $i$ with probability $\frac{1}{d}$, and step size $\eta$ which is smaller than $1/\left( 2 \sum_{t=1}^T (\qt_i^2 +{\Delta\vec{p}_{t}}_i^2) + \frac{\alpha d}{\kappa^2} + \beta\right)$. Let $\tilde{L}^*$ be the optimal value of $\tL$ on the PD cone. Let $\beta^* \geq \beta$ be the strong convexity parameter of $\tL$, $M^1$ a constant depending on the norm of the dataset, $1 > \rho >0, \epsilon>0$. Then:

If $t > \frac{ (M^1 + \alpha d (1/\kappa)^2 + \beta)}{d\beta^*} log \left( \frac{\tilde{L}(W^0) - \tilde{L}^*}{\epsilon \rho}\right)$ then $Prob(\tilde{L}(\W^t) - \tilde{L}^* \leq \epsilon) \geq 1-\rho$.

\section{Learning a block-sparse PD metric: Sparse COMET}\vskip -5pt
\ignore{The PD metric learned above can be used for extracting new features, but one is often interested to maintain interpretability with \emph{feature selection}: learn a metric which only relies on a small subset of the original feature set, or a small subset of feature pairs. To that end, we develop a method for learning feature-sparse PD metrics, using a block-coordinate descent method that maintains the PD property during training.}

\ignore{
The PD metric learned above does not take into account possible structures often found in feature interactions. }

In most high-dimensional learning problems, many feature pairs do not interact intensely with other features, meaning that their corresponding off-diagonal terms are zero. The PD metrics learned above fail to take into account such structure, leading to  "wasteful" inference that involves a $O(d^2)$ computation. To benefit from such structure, we propose to enforce a new type of structured sparsity, which can be optimized efficiently. Specifically, we suggest to allow only a small set of features to interact with \emph{any} of the other features, and eliminate the interaction term for any two features which are not in the ``interacting set''. Importantly, we also maintain weights for the individual features, corresponding to the diagonal term in the learned similarity matrix. Note that the interaction structure we suggest leads to sparse matrices, allowing for faster inference both during training and test time. 
Figure \ref{fig:spmatrix}a shows an example of such a sparse matrix.

In this section, we develop a method for learning PD metrics with this interaction structure, using a block-coordinate descent method that maintains the PD property throughout training.
In the metric learning setting, each feature corresponds to a row-column block which overlaps with all the other row-column blocks. For example, the first row-column of the matrix $\W$, corresponding to the first feature, intersects the $i$-th row-column at entries $W_{1i}$ and $W_{i1}$. We therefore use an \emph{overlapping decomposition} \citep{jacob2009group,obozinski2011group} of $W$ into blocks, as follows. 
We decompose the matrix $\W$ to group components matrices $\Vg$. The matrix $V_0$ is a diagonal matrix, and the matrices $V_k$ for $k>0$ are symmetric matrices of non-zeros only on the row $k$ and column $k$, with a all-zeros diagonal. Finally, we define $\W$ as the sum $\W = \sum_{k=0}^{d}{\Vk}$.
Given this definition of $\W$, the loss \eqref{eq-logdet-loss} can be expressed as a function of the groups $\Vg$:
\begin{equation}
L(\Vg) = 
  \min_{\Vg} \sum_{\trip \in \cal{T}}   l_{\W}(\qt, \pt^+, \pt^-) - \alpha \log \det(\sum_{k=0}^{d}{\Vk}).
  \label{group_loss}
\end{equation} 
The gradient of \eqref{group_loss} w.r.t. an element of $\mat{V}_k$ is therefore:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial {L (V_k)}}{\partial v_{ki}} = \sum\limits_{t\in \cal{T}}{\{
  [\tfrac{1}{2}[\q_{t}\Delta\p_{t}\T + \Delta\p_{t}\q_{t}\T]_{k,i}  }
  {l'}_W\triplet\} - \alpha [\W^{-1}]_{k,i},
  \label{grad_group}
\end{equation}
while for $k \geq 1$, $\frac{\partial {L (V_k)}}{\partial v_{li}}=0$ if  $l \neq k \wedge i \neq k$, or $l=i$. Note that the gradient term \eqref{grad_group} requires $\W^{-1}$, which we therefore maintain and update as in dense COMET.

Given these groups, we can add a group-sparse norm penalty to \eqref{group_loss} in order to encourage the use of fewer features:
\begin{equation}
L(\Vg) = 
  \min_{\Vg} \sum_{\trip \in \cal{T}}   l_{\W}(\qt, \pt^+, \pt^-) - \alpha \log \det(\sum_{k=0}^{d}{\Vk}) + \lambda \sum_{k=1}^d \|V_k\|_F,
  \label{sparse_group_loss}
\end{equation} 
where we note that it is possible to also add an $L_2$ or $L_2$-squared regularization factor to the diagonal group $V_0$. \eqref{sparse_group_loss} is a convex function of $\Vg$, where we note that the negative $\log \det$ term is a composition of a convex function with a linear function, and therefore convex.
The group sparse term $\lambda \sum_{i=1}^d \|V_k\|_F$ encourages some of the groups $V_k$, $1\leq k \leq d$ to be identically $0$. Since the groups $V_k$ control the off-diagonal terms of $W$, we see that for any pair $i\neq j$ such that $V_i=0, V_j=0$, the corresponding off-diagonal elements $W_{ij}$ will be $0$. 

Given the decomposition $\Vg$, we can optimize \eqref{sparse_group_loss} using standard block-coordinate methods for non-smooth objectives. Specifically we use the method of \citet{richtarik2014iteration}. Let $\mathcal{V}_k$ denote the set of $d \times d$ matrices which are all zero except the non-diagonal entries on the $k$-th row and column. At each block update, we solve the following proximal problem, which admits a closed form solution \citep{bach2012optimization}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:prox}
V_k^{new} = \argmin_{\mat{V} \in \mathcal{V}_k} \left\langle \frac{\partial{L (V_k)}}{\partial V_k}, \mat{V} \right\rangle + \frac{\theta}{2}\|V - V_k\|_F^2 + \lambda \|V\|_F,
\end{equation}
and then update $\W^{new} = \W + V_k^{new} - V_k$.

As with the dense case, the proximal step provides a theoretical convergence guarantee for a very conservative step size $\theta$, which ensures that at every update the iterate $\W^{new}$ remains within the PD cone.
%In practice we show how to use larger step sizes which result with faster convergence.
However, a large non-adaptive step size may result with a matrix $\W^{new}$ that is not PD. The approach we take is to set a maximal step-size $\theta_{max}$, but use the Schur complement bound to evaluate whether the update is still within the PD cone. In case it is not, we choose a smaller step-size that is guaranteed to maintain $W^{new}$ within the PD cone. We do this in a similar manner to the dense case, with some necessary adaptations. Evaluating the step size bound costs $O(d^2)$; details of the method are provided in Appendix E. 

We note that the proximal update \eqref{eq:prox} maintains many of the groups $V_k$ as identically zero. This results in a sparse update schedule, since a group that is $0$ often remains $0$, saving the computation of the PD bound and of updating $\W$. Therefore sparse COMET reduces the mean cost per step to $O(\rho d^2)$, where $\rho$ is the group sparsity of $\Vgrc$. The method is summarized in Algorithm~\ref{alg:spcomet}.

\noindent{\bf{Convergence.}}
Similar to the case of dense COMET, the objective $L(\Vg)$ in \eqref{group_loss} is strongly convex but not smooth. Let $\tilde{L}(\Vg) = L(\{\kappa I_d + V_0\} \cup \{V_k\}_{k=1}^d)$ be a modified version of the loss in \eqref{sparse_group_loss}, where $I_d$ is the $d \times d$ identity matrix, and $\kappa>0$ is a fixed parameter.
As shown in \cite[Theorem 7]{richtarik2014iteration}, the proximal block coordinate descent we use converges w.h.p. linearly to the optimal value, given that the maximal step size $\theta_{max}$ is smaller than the block-Lipschitz constants of $\tilde{L}(\Vg)$.

Table \ref{comp-complx} summarizes the asymptotic computational complexity of COMET and several competing methods. COMET's complexity is better than SGD-based methods which require repeated projections \citep{OASIS, qian}. COMET also has lower complexity than HDSL \citep{HDSL}.  Finally, in the regime of many samples with at least moderate sparsity, COMET's computational complexity is better than LEGO \citep{lego}. The derivation of the computational complexity results is given in Appendix C.

\section{Experiments}\vskip -5pt
We evaluate COMET on three datasets and compare it with four metric-learning approaches. 

\subsection{Competing approaches}\vskip -5pt
We compare the two COMET algorithms with 4 approaches that learn a Mahalanobis metric matrix while avoid repeated projections to the PD cone.

\textbf{(1) COMET}. The algorithms described in Algorithm~\ref{alg:comet} (dCOMET) and Algorithm~\ref{alg:spcomet} (spCOMET). We experimented with the linear hinge-loss for the triplets loss, see \eqref{eq-logdet-loss}. \textbf{(2) Euclidean}. The Euclidean similarity in the original feature space. COMET is initialized using the identity matrix, which is equivalent to this similarity measure.  \textbf{(3) HDSL} \citep{HDSL}. A Frank-Wolfe based approach tuned for high-dimensional sparse data. HDSL learns a convex combination of rank-1 PSD matrices that are all zeros except for a $2\times2$ pair of features elements. It iteratively adds these matrices, one feature-pair at a time, to control the number of active features. \textbf{(4) LEGO} \citep{lego}. This approach uses a $\log \det$ divergence term to enforce the PD constraint. The main variant of LEGO aims to fit pairwise distances. We used a variant of LEGO that, like COMET, learns from relative similarities. Loss is incurred for same-class samples farther than a certain distance, and different-class samples closer than a certain distance. We profiled and optimized the provided LEGO source code to decrease its run time, and made it significantly faster in large scale datasets. \textbf{(5) BoostMetric} \citep{boost}. Based on the observation that any positive semidefinite matrix can be decomposed into linear positive combination of rank-1 matrices, BoostMetric uses rank-1 PSD matrices as weak learners within a boosting based learning process.

\subsection{Datasets}\vskip -5pt
We evaluate COMET on three benchmark datasets.
\textbf{REUTERS CV1} is a collection of English text documents. We used the 4-class subset introduced in \citep{CaiRCV14} and was recently tested for metric learning in \citep{HDSL}. We used the \textit{infogain} criterion \citep{infogain} to select subsets of 5000 and 1000 features. It is a criterion, which measures the number of bits gained for category prediction by knowing the presence or absence of a term in a document. Each document was represented as a bag of words, where the weights of the selected features were \textit{tf-idf} transformed. The sparsity of this dataset, after selecting top 5000 features, is $1.3\%$. We used 100,000 triplets (and 200,000 LEGO constraints) for training. This is the same scale used in \citet{HDSL}. To train HDSL, we took 8000 iterations as in \citep{HDSL}. BoostMetric could not converge on this dataset due to memory and runtime issues caused by the large number of features. \textbf{CALTECH256} is a dataset of labeled images for visual object recognition. We used the subsets of 50 and 249 classes tested for metric learning in \citep{OASIS}. This set contains 65 images per class (total of 3250 images), represented with ~1000 \textit{bag-of-local-descriptors} features provided by these authors. The sparsity of this dataset is $3.3\%$. We used 135,000 triplets (and 300,000 LEGO constraints) for training, roughly as was used in \citep{OASIS}. To select the number of iterations in training HDSL we used early stopping on a validation set. BoostMetric was slow on this dataset, and used a large amount of memory. For a fair comparison, we took the number of COMET coordinate steps to be the maximal number of BoostMetric rank-1 updates. \textbf{PROTEIN} is a LIBSVM \citep{libsvm} dense dataset with 3 classes, 357 features and 24387 samples. It was recently tested for metric learning in \citep{qian}. We used 20,000 triplets (and 50,000 LEGO constraints) for training.

\vskip -12pt
\end{figure}

\subsection{Experimental setup and Evaluation measures}\vskip -5pt
In all datasets, two samples are considered similar if they share the same class label. Each data set is tested on a two layer 5 fold cross validation experiment. We use the same (frozen) random splits across all approaches. Training all learners with the exact same set of triplets, except for LEGO that uses pairs constraints. We verified that we choose the triplets/constraints number in a regime such that test performance converges (figures not shown due to space constraints). We generated triplets randomly while keeping a fixed number of triplets per query sample.

We evaluated the performance of all algorithms using standard ranking precision measures based on nearest neighbors. For each query instance in the test set, all other test instances were ranked according to their similarity to the query instance. The number of same-class instances
among the top $k$ instances (the $k$-nearest-neighbors) was computed, and averaged to  yields the \textit{precision-at-k},
providing a precision curve as a function of the rank $k$. \textit{Precision-at-k} for $k$ >1 is useful in retrieval of multiple objects that are similar to a query object, e.g. an image search engine.
%To obtain fast hyper parameters search for sparse COMET, we aborted the training after $0.2 d$ steps when the row sparsity of $\Vgrc$ to that moment was denser than 30\%.

\subsection{Results}\vskip -5pt
We evaluated \textit{precision-at-k} on the test set as a function of $k$ neighbours, averaged across 5 random train/test partitions (80\%/20\%). We discuss results for RCV1 5000 features, and Caltech256 50 categories, and give resutls with the other sets in Appendix F.
\ignore{Figure \ref{cometConvergeFig} shows the \textit{precision-at-k} over the test sets as it progresses during learning. 
}
We observed that convergence is usually achieved after $6 \cdot d$ to $8 \cdot d$ coordinate steps for dense COMET and $8 \cdot d$ to $11 \cdot d$ with sparse COMET.
Surprisingly, when tuning hyper-parameter values, we found that the Frobenius regularizer obtained very small weights, and setting its coefficient to zero did not harm performance. 

Figure \ref{precFig} compares the precision obtained by sparse and dense COMET with four competing approaches, as described above. Both sparse and dense COMET achieved consistently superior or equal results throughout the full range of number of neighbours tested.
In Figure \ref{spCometPrecTime} we show the precision on RCV1 of sparse COMET over several sparsity levels, and compare it with dense COMET and the Euclidean baseline. It demonstrates sparse-COMET can achieve $99\%$ of the nearest neighbor precision of dense COMET, while cutting training time by a factor of $4.5$ and maintaining a $0.5\%$ sparsity level. Moreover, although it is highly sparse, it outperforms competing methods both in precision and in run time.

We also compared dense COMET with OASIS on the Caltech dataset. OASIS is a method that learns a non-PSD similarity matrix. It was shown to yield better precision on the Caltech dataset \citep{OASIS}. Dense COMET achieves near identical precision to OASIS, probably because both methods essentially optimize a very similar objective.

\section{Summary}\vskip -5pt
We presented COMET, a new metric learning approach that avoids both costly projections and unnecessary computation of full gradients. It continuously maintains the PD property, and allows feature extraction and embedding of samples in a metric space throughout the training. We demonstrated a sparse variant of COMET, where we enforced structured sparsity, where only a small number of features can interact with other features. Significantly accelerating both training and inference, maintaining interpretability and outperforming competing methods.

%The combination of coordinate steps with sparse enforcement presents an interesting direction for future research. One could cut training time by making a smarter scheduling of coordinates selection with a probability that is proportional to its norm. Another speed-up possibility is applying a fill reducing permutation to the rows of the Cholesky decomposition $L$ of $\W$, thus inducing sparsity over the rows of $L$. Doing so can reduce the complexity per step to $O(nnz(\W))$ and it may \emph{enable interpretability} at the embedded metric space.

\section*{Appendix A. Details of gradient derivation for a triplet}
\label{appendix-grad}

To compute matrix gradient step $\frac{\partial {l_t (\W)}}{\partial \W}$ of an arbitrary triplet $t$, we denote the linear part of the hinge loss of a triplet $t$ by $\lambda_{W}^t \eqdef 
1-\qt\T \W \pt^{+} + \qt\T\W\pt^{-}.$

$\W$ is PD and therefore symmetric. We enforce its gradient to be symmetric by replacing $\W$ with $\tfrac{1}{2}(\W + \W\T)$.
The derivative of the ranking loss is then given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial {l_{\W}^{t}}}{\partial \W} = \tfrac{1}{2}[\vec{q}_{t}\Delta\vec{p}_{t}\T  + \Delta\vec{p}_{t}\vec{q}_{t}\T]\cdot {l'}(\lambda_{W}^t)
\label{dlossranking}
\nonumber 
\end{equation} where $l'(x) \eqdef \frac{d{l(x)}}{dx}$ is the outer derivative of the loss function, $\Delta\vec{p}_{t} \eqdef (\vec{p}_{t}^{-} - \vec{p}_{t}^{+})$.

\section*{Appendix B. Deriving the condition for the bound on step size and updating the inverse matrix}
\label{appendix-inverse}

Without loss of generality, assume that the current round updates the first feature ($k = 1$). We write the pre- and post-update
matrices, as
\begin{equation}
  \W = \left[ \begin{matrix} \C & \B\T \\ \B & A \end{matrix} \right],
  \quad
  \newW = \left[ \begin{matrix} \C^* & \B^*\T \\ \B^* & A^* \end{matrix} \right],
  \label{schurNotationPreUpdate}
\end{equation}
 where $\C = \Wscalar \in \R$ (a scalar), $\B = \Wvec \in
\R^{d-1}$ (a column vector) and $A = \W_{2:d,2:d} \in \R^{(d-1)
\times (d-1)}$. Similarly for $A^*$, $\B^*$ and $\C^*$.

According to the Schur complement condition for positive definiteness
\citep[p. 650]{boyd2004convex}, $\newW$ is PD iff both
$A^*$ and $\C^* - \B^*\T A^{*-1} \B^*$ are positive definite.
Since $W \succ 0$ and $A$ is a minor of $\W$ which is left unchanged by the update, we have $A^* =
A \succ 0$. Moreover, $\C^* - \B^*\T A^{*-1} \B^*$ is a
scalar, yielding
\begin{equation}
  \newW \succ  0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad  \C^* - \B^*\T \invA \B^* >  0.
  \label{schurCond}
\end{equation}
Now let $\uscalar = \C^* - \C$ and $\uvec = \B^* - \B$ be the updated scalar and vector
obtained from $\eta G = \newW - \W$. We expand \eqref{schurCond} and
\eqref{gradMtx} (with $k=1$) yielding a necessary and sufficient condition for $\newW \succ 0$: $(\Wscalar + 2\eta \uscalar)-(\Wvec + \eta \uvec)\T \invA (\Wvec + \eta \uvec)   > 0$.
Grouping as a quadratic inequality in $\eta$, and using the notation from \eqref{schurNotationPreUpdate} we result with
\begin{equation}
\label{PDUpdateCondQuadForm}
(\uvec\T \invA \uvec) \, \eta^2 
-2(\uscalar - \uvec\T \invA \B) \,\eta 
-(\C - \B\T  \invA \B) < 0 .
\end{equation}
For $\eta = 0$, this inequality always
holds since $\W \succ 0$ guarantees that $\C-\B^{\T} \invA \B >0$. As a result,
 \eqref{PDUpdateCondQuadForm} always has a real
root $\eta > 0$. This root provides an upper bound on $\eta$ that guarantees that $\newW$ is PD. Computing the coefficients involves computing bilinear terms and costs $O(d^2)$ if $\invA$ is given.



In practice for evaluating the condition in \eqref{PDUpdateCondQuadForm} efficiently, we maintains an updated Cholesky root matrix $\cholL$ s.t. $\W = \cholL\T \cholL$. It enables us to efficiently derive a Cholseky for $\A$ \citep{Davis05rowchol} and in turn efficiently evaluate the terms of \eqref{PDUpdateCondQuadForm} with a cost of $O(d^2)$. 

For evaluating the $\log\det$ gradient, $\newW^{-1}$ can be easily computed using the Woodbury matrix
identity \citep{woodbury1950inverting}. We rewrite the update and \eqref{gradMtx}, using $\newW = \W + \eta G = \W+\mat{\widetilde{G}}$
 %\label{updateEqWDB}
and write
\begin{equation}
  \mat{\widetilde{G}} = \mat{U}\mat{C}\mat{V} = \left[ \begin{matrix}
      \vec{u} & \vec{e_k} \end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{matrix}
      \eta & 0 \\ 0 & \eta \end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{matrix}
      \vec{e_k}\T \\ \vec{u}\T \end{matrix} \right],
  \label{gradMtxWDB}
  \nonumber 
\end{equation}
where $\vec{u}$ is a column vector that equals the column $k$ of the gradient matrix of the objective \eqref{gradMtx},
$\vec{e_k}$ equals an elementary vector for selecting a column $k$ of
a matrix. 
Using the Woodbury matrix identity gives 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    \newW^{-1} = 
    \W^{-1} - \W^{-1} \mat{U} (\eta^{-1} I_2 + \mat{V}     \W^{-1} \mat{U})^{-1} \mat{V} \W^{-1}
    \end{array}
    \nonumber
    \label{InvWwdb}
\end{equation}

 

\section*{Appendix C. Analysis of computational complexity}


We first evaluate the computational complexity of a single coordinate step \eqref{gradMtx}, including the computation of the gradient and updating of $\W$, $\W^{-1}$ and the Cholesky decomposition of $\W$. Consider first the computation of the gradient. For the hinge-loss case $l^{h}_W$, each element $\delta_{i,j}$ of the gradient matrix \eqref{gradMtx} equals
\begin{equation}
    \delta_{(i,j)} = \sum\limits_{t\in \cal{T}}{ [\tfrac{1}{2}[(\vec{q}_{t})_i(\Delta\vec{p}_{t}\T)_j + (\Delta\vec{p}_{t}\T)_i(\vec{q}_{t})_j\T] } \cdot \textbf{1}(\lambda_{W}^t) - \alpha \cdot \W^{-1}_{i,j} + \beta \cdot \W_{i,j},
\label{gradMatElem}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_{W}^t \eqdef 1+\qt\T \W \Delta\p_{t}$ is the linear part a triplet loss

For dense \emph{data}, evaluating the sum over $T$ triplets costs $O(T)$ operations. However, for $gamma$-sparse data with a sparsity coefficient $ 0< \gamma <1 $, evaluating the sum in \eqref{gradMatElem} costs an average of $O(\gamma^2 T)$ operations, because we can accumulate only the elements that are both non-zeros in $(\vec{q}_{t})_i$ and in $(\Delta\vec{p}_{t}\T)_j  $ and likewise for $(\vec{q}_{t})_j$ and $(\Delta\vec{p}_{t}\T)_i$.   To efficiently evaluate the indicator functions $\{ \textbf{1}(\lambda_{W}^t) \}_{t \in T}$ on \eqref{gradMatElem}, we keep an array of the linear terms $\{\lambda_{W}^t\}_{t \in T}$. Computing all the gradient elements $\delta_{(k,1:d)}$ in a single row $k$ costs $O(d\cdot \gamma^2 T)$.
Maintaining and updating $\W^{-1}$ and the Cholesky decomposition of $\W$, and computing the optimal step size following equations on Appendix B, each costs $O(d^2)$ operations. 
To conclude, the total computational complexity per an active block-coordinate step is $O(\gamma^2 d T + d^2)$. 
For dense COMET, when taking $Nd$ coordinate steps, the overall complexity of dense COMET is 
\begin{equation}
O(N \cdot (\gamma d)^2 T + N \cdot d^3)
\label{cometComplexity}
\end{equation}

For sparse COMET, when taking $\rho N d$ active coordinate steps and $(1-\rho) Nd$ zero-update coordinate steps, the overall complexity of sparse COMET is

\begin{equation}
O(N \cdot (\gamma d)^2 T + \rho N \cdot d^3)
\label{spcometComplexity}
\end{equation}

We found empirically that COMET converges within $6 \cdot d$ to $8 \cdot d$ coordinate steps for dense COMET and $8 \cdot d$ to $11 \cdot d$ with sparse COMET. As a comparison, consider using SGD or mini-batches for the objective of \eqref{eq-logdet-loss} (with $
\alpha = 0$) and projecting onto the PD cone every $P$ triplets ($P \ll T$), as proposed in \citep{OASIS,qian}. The computational complexity per data pass becomes $O((\gamma d)^2 T + \frac{T}{P} d^3)$. This approach is slower than COMET and only reaches the complexity of COMET when projections are very rare. For example, \citet{qian} used mini-batches of $P=10$ triplets. With a total of $T=100k$ triplets, yielding a computational complexity ~1000 times larger than COMET.

Compare further with \citet{HDSL}. COMET’s complexity is better than HDSL. The fast heuristic version of HDSL is $O(M\gamma d+Tk)$ per coordinate step, where $M$ is the size of mini-batch, $k$ is the iteration number. This is summed over $k=1,...,O(d^2)$ iterations, since each HDSL step considers a single pair of features, updating 4 matrix entries as opposed to $2d-1$ entries in COMET. Overall, this yields $O(M\gamma d^3+Td^4)$ computations for HDSL, compared with \eqref{cometComplexity} of COMET. Since both $M$ and $N$ are typically small, this means HDSL is more costly than COMET by a factor of $\frac{d^2}{N}$. In our experiments, HDSL sometimes uses much less than $O(d^2)$ iterations, but then achieves a significantly inferior test error. We believe that HDSL would excel in cases where the true optimum is very sparse, and there is no need to go over the entire set of $d \choose 2$ coordinate pairs.

Finally, we compare with the complexity of LEGO \citep{lego}. LEGO requires $O(d^2)$ computation per constraint. Thus for $N$ passes over $T$ triplets LEGO's complexity is $O(N\cdot d^2 \cdot T)$. Assuming an equal number of passes over the triplet, we find that COMET's complexity \eqref{cometComplexity} is asymptotically better than LEGO as long as $N \cdot T \cdot (1-\gamma^2) > d^2$. That is, whenever the data is even moderately sparse, and the number of triplets is larger than the number of matrix parameters.

{\bf dense and sparse COMET Memory footprint}: Keeping the data triplets in memory takes $O(\gamma d T)$ elements and holding $\W$ and $\W^{-1}$ and the Cholesky decomposition costs $O(d^2)$. The total memory usage is $O(\gamma d T + d^2)$. 


\section*{Appendix D. Proofs and Lemmas}

There is a well established body of work showing that with non-overlapping blocks, block-coordinate descent iterates converge w.h.p. in a linear rate to the optimum value \citep{nesterov2012efficiency,richtarik2014iteration}.
However, the blocks we use in our method are overlapping - for example the $(1,2)$ coordinate of the matrix is a part of both the 1\textsuperscript{st} and the 2\textsuperscript{nd} column-row. To address this case, we use a more general convergence result applicable to overlapping blocks, given by \citet{richtarik2013optimal}. \citeauthor{richtarik2013optimal} give a very general result, suitable for \emph{any} distribution over the set of coordinate subsets. 
Specifically of interest to us, \citeauthor{richtarik2013optimal} give sufficient conditions for a linear convergence rate of overlapping block-coordinate descent with a strongly convex smooth objective. 
We use a relatively simple distribution over coordinate subsets: we have $d$ overlapping blocks corresponding to the column-rows of the matrix, each sampled with a probability $p_i$, $i=1 \ldots d$ (in the experiments below we used a uniform $p_i = \frac{1}{d}$).

The step sizes implied by the convergence theory presented in this section are conservative underestimates, especially since many of the constants involved in obtaining the step-sizes cannot be evaluated exactly but can only be upper-bounded. In practice, we found that much faster convergence is gained using larger steps while staying within the PD cone, using the Schur complement driven procedure described in detail in section \ref{subsec:step}.

To show convergence, we must prove our objective satisfies two assumptions: Assumption 1, called ``Expected Separable Overapproximation'', is that in expectation over the choice of blocks the function is smooth w.r.t. an inner product given by the coordinate probabilities. Assumption 2 is that the objective is strongly convex. In addition, for technical reasons the objective must be differentiable. This means that technically our proof is only valid for the squared hinge-loss and log-loss, but not the non-differentiable hinge-loss.

To fulfill the conditions in \citep{richtarik2013optimal}, we must slightly modify the objective function $L({\W})$. The objective $L(\W)$ is strongly convex but is not smooth, since the gradient of the $\log \det$ term is unbounded near the envelope of the PD cone. Let $\tilde{L}({\W}) = L({\W + \kappa I_d})$ be a modified version of the loss in Eq. \ref{eq-logdet-loss}, where $I_d$ is the $d \times d$ identity matrix, and $\kappa>0$ is a fixed parameter.
Note that our algorithm can easily minimize $\tilde{L}$, the only difference being that we now need to maintain and update both $\W^{-1}$ and $(\W+\kappa I_d)^{-1}$, which does not change the asymptotic computational complexity. The additional $\kappa I_d$ term acts as a bias term, where we add a constant Euclidean distance term to the distance we learn. We note that in practice we found that simply setting $\kappa=0$ had no detrimental effect on our performance. 

We show that the modified objective $\tilde{L}$ obeys Assumptions $1$ and $2$ of \citet{richtarik2013optimal}. Thereby, according to Theorem 3 of \citeauthor{richtarik2013optimal}, Algorithm \ref{alg:comet} converges with high probability to the optimum value in a linear rate:

\begin{theorem}
Let $\W^t$ be the $t$-th iterate of Algorithm \ref{alg:comet} with objective function $\tL$, sampling each column-row $i$ with probability $p_i$. Let $\tilde{L}^*$ be the optimal value of $\tL$ on the PD cone. Let $\beta^* \geq \beta$ be the strong convexity parameter of $\tL$, $M^1$ a constant depending on the norm of the dataset, $\Lambda = \max_i \frac{1}{p_i}$, $\rho >0, \epsilon>0$. Then:

If $t > \frac{\Lambda (M^1 + \alpha d (1/\kappa)^2 + \beta)}{\beta^*} log \left( \frac{\tilde{L}(W^0) - \tilde{L}^*}{\epsilon \rho}\right)$ then $Prob(\tilde{L}(\W^t) - \tilde{L}^* \leq \epsilon) \geq 1-\rho$.
\end{theorem}


We first establish two auxiliary lemmas, then proceed to the proof of Theorem 1.
\label{appendix-proofs}
\begin{lemma}[Smooth objective]
\label{lem:smooth}

Let:

$\tL=\sum\limits_{t\in T}{l_{\W + \kappa I}(\vec{q}_t, \vec{p}_{t}^{+}, \vec{p}_{t}^{-})} -
\alpha \cdot \log \det(\W + \kappa I) + \tfrac{\beta}{2}  \cdot \| \W + \kappa I \|_{F}^{2}$, 
where $l_{\W + \kappa I}$ is either the squared hinge loss or the log-loss, and $\tL$ is defined over the positive semidefininte cone. 
Let $\Hh^i \in \R^{d \times d}$, $i=1 \ldots d$, be a symmetric matrix with non-zero entries only on the $i$-th row and column.
For any $\W$ and $\Hh^i$ such that $\W + \Hh^i$ is PSD, there exists a positive constant $M_i$ such that:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ineq}
\Delta L \leq  \langle \grd, \Hh^i \rangle + \frac{M_i}{2} \frobsq{\Hh^i} = \sum_{k,l=1}^d  \grdkl \Hh_{kl}^i + \frac{M_i}{2} \sum_{k,l=1}^d  (\Hh_{kl}^i)^2, \nonumber
\end{equation}
with the constant $M_i \leq  2 \sum_{t=1}^T (\qt_i^2 +{\Delta\vec{p}_{t}}_i^2) + \frac{\alpha d}{\kappa ^2} + \beta$ and $\Delta L = \tilde{L}(\W + \Hh^i) - \tL$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}%[\bf{Proof of Lemma 1}]
The objective $\tL$ is comprised of three terms: (1) the sum of loss terms, (2) the $\log \det$ term, and (3) the Frobenius regularization term. We will bound each of the separately, denoting the positive bounding constants $M^1_i$, $M^2_i$ and $M^3_i$, respectively. 
%The Frobenius norm term ensures that $\tL$ is at least $\beta$ strongly-convex.

Assuming the instances $\qt$ and $\pt$ are unit normalized, straightforward computation shows that for the term (1), inequality \ref{eq:ineq} holds true for $M^1_i \leq 2 \sum_{t=1}^T (\qt_i^2 +{\Delta\vec{p}_{t}}_i^2)$. %This means that if the features are more or less equally weighted, $M^1_i$ is very roughly on the order of $\frac{T}{d}$.

To show that \ref{eq:ineq} is true for the $-\log \det$ term, we bound the maximal eigenvalue of its Hessian $\mathcal{H}$, which upper bounds $M_i^2$ by convexity and standard use of a Taylor expansion.
The Hessian is a $d^2 \times d^2$ PSD matrix, due to convexity and twice-differentiability of $- \log \det$. At every point $\mat{X} = \W + \kappa I$, $\W \succ 0$, the Hessian $\mathcal{H}(\mat{X})$ defines a bilinear form $\mathcal{B}_{\mat{X}}\left(\mat{P},\mat{Q}\right)$ on the set of symmetric $d \times d$ matrices. This bilinear form is $\mathcal{B}_{\mat{X}}\left(\mat{P},\mat{Q}\right) = tr\left(\mat{X}^{-1}\mat{P} \mat{X}^{-1}\mat{Q}\right)$ \citep[Appendix A]{boyd2004convex}. We then have:
\begin{align*}
&\max eig(\mathcal{H}) = \max_{\|\mat{P}\|_F=1} \mathcal{B}_{\mat{X}}\left(\mat{P},\mat{P}\right) = \\
&\max_{\|\mat{P}\|_F=1} tr\left(\mat{X}^{-1}\mat{P} \mat{X}^{-1}\mat{P}\right) \leq \\
&\max_{\|\mat{P}\|_F=1} \|\mat{X}^{-1} \mat{P}\|_F^2 \leq \|\mat{X}^{-1}\|_F^2 \leq  \\
& d \|\mat{X}^{-1}\|^2 = \frac{d}{\|\mat{X}\|^2} \leq \frac{d}{\kappa^2},
\end{align*}
where in the last line we denote the spectral norm (maximum singular value) of $\mat{X}$ by $\|\mat{X}\|$. The last inequality is due to the fact that $\mat{X} = \W + \kappa I$, $\W \succ 0$.
We therefore have a bound $M^2_i \leq \frac{\alpha d}{\kappa^2}$.

Finally, the constant $M^3_{i}$ for the Frobenius regularization is immediately seen to be $\beta$.

Collecting all the terms together, we obtain an overall bound on the constant: $M_i \leq M^1_{i} + M^2_{i} + M^3_{i} \leq  M^1_{i} + \frac{\alpha d}{\kappa ^2} + \beta$.
\end{proof}

Let us define a matrix $\Pp \in \R^{d \times d}$ such that $\Pp_{ij} = p_i + p_j$ for $i \ne j$, $\Pp_{ii} = p_i$. $\Pp$ is defined such that $\Pp_{ij}$ is the probability of updating the $(i,j)$ entry of the matrix $\W$ at any given iteration. To show our method converges in a linear rate, we must show that $\tL$, $\Pp$ and the constants $M_i$ satisfy the ``Expected Separable Overapproximation'' assumption presented by \citet{richtarik2013optimal}:

\begin{lemma}[Expected Separable Overapproximation]\label{lem:ESO}
For any symmetric $\Hh \in \R^{d \times d}$ such that $\W + \Hh$ is PSD, let $\Hh^i \in \R^{d \times d}$, $i=1 \ldots d$ be identical to $\Hh$ on the $i$-th row and column, and $0$ elsewhere. Then:
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}_{i \sim Mult(p_1, \ldots, p_d)} \left[ \tilde{L}(\W + \Hh^i) \right] \leq 
\tL + \sum_{k,l=1}^d  \grdkl \Hh_{kl} \Pp_{kl} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k,l=1}^d   M_k (\Hh_{kl})^2 \Pp_{kl},
\end{equation}
where $i$ is sampled from a multinomial distribution with parameters $(p_1, \ldots , p_d)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}%[\bf{Proof of Lemma 2}]
\begin{align*}
&\mathbb{E}_{i \sim Mult(p_1, \ldots, p_d)} \left[ \tilde{L}(\W + \Hh^i) \right] =\sum_{i=1}^d p_i \tilde{L}(\W + \Hh^i) \stackrel{(a)}{\leq} \\
& \sum_{i=1}^d p_i \left(\tL + \sum_{k,l=1}^d \grdkl \Hh_{kl}^i + \frac{M_i}{2} \sum_{k,l=1}^d  (\Hh_{kl}^i)^2 \right) \stackrel{(b)}{=} \\
& \tL + \sum_{k,l=1}^d \grdkl \sum_{i=1}^d  p_i \Hh_{kl}^i + \sum_{k,l=1}^d  \sum_{i=1}^d  p_i \frac{M_i}{2} (\Hh_{kl}^i)^2  \stackrel{(c)}{=} \\
& \tL + \sum_{k,l=1}^d \grdkl \Hh_{kl} \Pp_{kl} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k,l=1}^d M_k (\Hh_{kl})^2 \Pp_{kl}.
\end{align*}
Inequality (a) is due to Lemma \ref{lem:smooth}. Equality (b) is by changing the order of summation and since the $p_i$ sum to 1. Equality (c) is by a simple counting argument, and the fact that $\Hh^i$ is the restriction of $\Hh$ to its $i$-th row and column. Each off-diagonal element $\Hh_{kl}$ appears twice in the sum over $i$: when $i=k$ and $i=l$. This is accounted for by the elements $\Pp_{kl} = p_k + p_l$.
\end{proof}

% \begin{theorem}
% Let $\W^t$ be the $t$-th iterate of Algorithm \ref{alg:comet} with objective function $\tL$, sampling each column-row $i$ with probability $p_i$ and using step sizes $\eta_i \leq \frac{1}{M_i}$. Let $\tilde{L}^*$ be the optimal value of $\tL$ on the PD cone. Let $\beta^* \geq \beta$ be the strong convexity parameter of $\tL$, $M^1 = \max_i M^1_i$, $\Lambda = \max_i \frac{1}{p_i}$, $\rho >0, \epsilon>0$, and $W^t$ the $t$ iterate of Algorithm \ref{alg:comet}.

% If $t > \frac{\Lambda (M^1 + \alpha d (1/\kappa)^2 + \beta)}{\beta^*} log \left( \frac{\tilde{L}(W^0) - \tilde{L}^*}{\epsilon \rho}\right)$ then: $Prob(\tilde{L}(\W^k) - \tilde{L}^* \leq \epsilon) \geq 1-\rho$.
% \end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[{\bf{Theorem 1}}]
We show that Algorithm \ref{alg:comet} with objective function $\tL$ squared-hinge loss or log loss), sampling each column-row $i$ with probability $p_i >0$, and using step sizes $\eta_i \leq \frac{1}{M_i}$, follows Assumption 1 and Assumption 2 of \citet{richtarik2013optimal}. From this the convergence result follows from \citeauthor[Theorem 3]{richtarik2013optimal}, plugging in our bounds regarding the smoothness and strong convexity of $\tL$.

We first note that our algorithm is indeed a special case of the algorithm presented in \citet{richtarik2013optimal}. Specifically, our algorithm assigns probability $p_i > 0 $ to each of the $d$ column-rows of a matrix, and probability $0$ to every other possible choice of coordinates. We update along this block, and the $\log \det$ term acts as a barrier function
assuring us we will stay within the PD cone.

Lemma \ref{lem:ESO} shows our objective is smooth and satisfies Assumption 1 of \citeauthor{richtarik2013optimal}. Assumption 2 of \citeauthor{richtarik2013optimal} is immediately satisfied because of the Frobenius regularization term, ensuring a strong convexity term $\beta^* \geq \beta > 0$. The result follows by considering that the probability $\Pp_{ij}$ of updating coordinate $(i,j)$ obeys $\Pp_{ij} \geq \min_i p_i $ and the values of $M_i$ given in Lemma \ref{lem:smooth}.

\end{proof}

\section*{Appendix E. Selecting the step size for the sparse proximal step}
In section \ref{subsec:step} we demonstrated how to select the step size \eqref{PDUpdateCondQuadForm} for a single row-column update given a PD matrix and and a single row-column update matrix $\mat{G}$. 

The same method can't be directly applied to evaluate the proximal step size $\theta$ because the closed form solution for the proximal step \eqref{eq:prox} $\Vk^{new}$ is a sum of a gradient step and a shrinkage operation

\begin{equation*}
 \begin{cases}
   H \eqdef (V_k-\theta G_k) \\ 
   \Vk^{new} = \Hk [1 - \frac{\lambda}{||\Hk||}]_+ & \text{if}\  k \geq 1\\
   \Vk^{new} = \Hk & \text{if}\ k = 0 \\ 
 \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where $G_k$ is a matrix notation of the gradient step, as was discussed in \ref{learing_dense_comet}. 

The following approach is applied to decide whether the step size bound $\eta$ by \eqref{PDUpdateCondQuadForm} also holds for the proximal step, and if not it finds a smaller step size that can fulfill it.


\newcommand{\Vkorigin}{\emph{origin }}
$\Hk$ is the gradient step with respect to $\Vk$. We apply \eqref{PDUpdateCondQuadForm} to evaluate $\eta$ and the maximal update $\Hk^{max}$ in the direction of $\Hk$. Therefore, it is easy to see that any point on a vector $H$ between $[\W, \W + \Hk^{max})$ will result with a PD update. We define an \Vkorigin which is the point where the proximal step will result with $\vec{0}$. To clarify this point, note that it is \emph{not a zero update.} Instead it means that $\Vk^{new}$ is all zeros, and hence that kind of update would result with $\newW = \W - \Vk$. Next, we use the fact that the PD cone is convex, and therefore, if the \Vkorigin resides inside the PSD cone, then, any point on a vector that connects \Vkorigin with another point on a vector $H$ between $[\W, \W + \Hk^{max})$ resides inside the PD cone. Therefore, for any $\theta < \eta$ the proximal step $\Vk^{new}$ results on vector that connects the \Vkorigin with a point on $[\W, \W + \Hk^{max})$, and therefore, any such result is PD. In a similar fashion as in \eqref{PDUpdateCondQuadForm}, we can easily check if the \Vkorigin resides inside the PSD cone.  

Summing it up, we derived an upper bound for the step size by showing that if \Vkorigin resides in the PSD cone, then any proximal step with a size $\theta < \eta$ would result inside the PD cone. The \Vkorigin positive-definiteness can be easily evaluated by following a similar approach as in \eqref{PDUpdateCondQuadForm}. The cost of such evaluation is $O(d^2)$

In the case the \Vkorigin resides outside the cone, we can check what is the most distant point from $\W$ on the direction of the \Vkorigin, we label this point as $\widetilde{\Vk}$. Again any point on a vector that connects $\widetilde{\Vk}$ with a point on $[\W, \W + \Hk^{max})$ is PD. However, now only a subset of the proximal steps with $\theta < \eta$ will result inside the PD cone. Since the proximal steps reside on a continues locus, this subset is also continues. Therefore, we can find the maximal step size with few binary search steps, starting from $\theta = \eta$ and varying $\theta$ by 50\% on each iteration. In practice, we found that even when we learn a moderately sparse metric ($\rho \leq 30\%$), it is very rare that the \Vkorigin is not PD. Therefore, on our experiments we skip the update in case its \Vkorigin is not PD.

One should note, that since we have two evaluation of step size bound, a single active step of sparse COMET would take approximately twice the time in comparison to dense COMET. Therefore, in the case it is required to learn a dense matrix, dense COMET would be faster.

To conclude, we demonstrated how to evaluate a bound on the step size that maintains the proximal step inside the PD cone. Therefore, during training we can adaptively set the step size accordingly.
